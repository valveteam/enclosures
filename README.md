During the latter stages of the project we undertook some initial work to investigate the design of enclosures for our electronic modules, and provide design files at handover to the Majico team.

## Main Enclosure

The main enclosure is essentially a box, and this can be built to enclose both the control and flow modules together. A picture of the manufactured box is below.

##Â Light Module Enclosure

The concept for the light module was to produce a tray that would mount the light sensor module to the underside of the PET screen that forms the sunlight-facing face of the photocatalytic reactor unit itself. This solves a lot of problems for Majico:

* It is not possible for the light module to be jolted so it no longer faces the same light intensity as the reactor.
* The light sensor can't be covered with dirt or shadow if the photocatalytic reactor isn't similarly affected.

An image is given below.
